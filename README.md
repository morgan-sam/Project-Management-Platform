<h3>Project Management Platform</h3>
<p>PMP is a platform for managing task lists for projects.</p>

<p>Authentification is not yet implemented. Once implemented the manager account will be able to view the complete task list and assign tasks to individual teams. A team account will only be able to view the tasks assigned to them and tick them off as they are completed.</p>
