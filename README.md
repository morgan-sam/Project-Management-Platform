<h3>Project Management Platform</h3>
<p>PMP is a platform for managing task lists for projects.</p>

<h3>Usage</h3>
<h4>Batching New Tasks</h4>
<p>Multiple tasks can be added to the database by using a single template.</p>
<p>The syntax of the templating is listed below:</p>
<h4>Task</h4>
<p><code>${n/l, #, a/d}</code></p>
<p>
  Where: 
  <ul>
    <li>n = number, l = letter</li>
    <li># = number of digits, (skipped for letter)</li>
    <li>a = ascending, d = descending</li>
  </ul>
</p>
<h3>To Do</h3>
<p>Authentification is not yet implemented. Once implemented the manager account will be able to view the complete task list and assign tasks to individual teams. A team account will only be able to view the tasks assigned to them and tick them off as they are completed.</p>
